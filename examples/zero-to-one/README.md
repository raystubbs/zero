# Zero To One

Zero to One is a bare bones example.

It demonstrates how to:

1. Set up a build with Shadow CLJS
2. Run a test suite
3. Render a component
4. Use a CSS stylesheet

## Getting Started

Zero to One uses Shadow CLJS. To get started, run:

```
npx shadow-cljs app test
```

This starts both the app and test builds.

To see the tests, open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`.

To see the app, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
