# Zero To One

Zero to One is an example of how to get started with Zero.

It demonstrates how to:

1. Set up a build with Shadow CLJS
2. Run a test suite
3. Render a component
4. Use a CSS stylesheet
5. Server side render the components

## Getting Started

To get started, run:

```
clj -X:dev
```

This will:

- Start an nrepl server, with the shadow middleware for the cljs repl
- Start the app and test shadow builds
- Start the backend server

To see the app, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

To see the tests, open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`.
