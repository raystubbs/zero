# Zero: Next
Zero has evolved into a bit of a mess as I've explored
and learned about the domain.  But it's also become really
powerful.  I already feel much more productive in Zero
than I ever did in re-frame.

This ns will house a better-designed rewrite of Zero from
(almost) the ground up.  While the original API will be
maintained (for the time being) for backwards compatibility.
